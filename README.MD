# Knightly

## Introduction
This is my take on [BracketProduction's](https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/) Rust Roguelike Tutorial. The name is taken from the tutorials sub-domain "bf`[k]nightly`"; it was a stretch, but I'm running with it...

While this project has been re-created other times, I get my chance too, so here we go!

This is my take, and I'm not interested in releasing on the web. This is not a remake of the tutorial. Go read it... it's great, lots of people use it and like it. I am only using different technologies ([Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/)) while trying to stay close to the source material.

Also note: I am not an artist.
